## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public issue for a security vulnerability.

Instead, report it by email to the maintainers (see the repository owner’s GitHub profile or package metadata). Include a description of the issue, steps to reproduce, and any suggested fix if you have one. We will respond as soon as we can and will work with you on a fix and disclosure timeline.

Thank you for helping keep Replayx and its users safe.
